# provo-garage-sale

We began with the name "Provo Garage Sale" and ended with "Local Yard Sales".

"We" are Sherlyn Burkhart, Trae Durtschi, James Niroomand, Justin Regan, and Jason Turner.  Jason graduated from devMountain in 2014 and acted as the mid-level developer. The rest of the team are aspiring junior developers and graduated August 2015. This was our first group project.

The site is hosted under the name:
localyardsal.es.
